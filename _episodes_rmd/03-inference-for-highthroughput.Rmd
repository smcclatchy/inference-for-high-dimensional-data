## Inference in Practice

Suppose we were given high-throughput gene expression data that was measured for 
several individuals in two populations. We are asked to report which genes have 
different average expression levels in the two populations. If instead of 
thousands of genes, we were handed data from just one gene, we could simply 
apply the inference techniques that we have learned before. We could, for 
example, use a t-test or some other test. Here we review what changes when we 
consider high-throughput data.

#### p-values are random variables

An important concept to remember in order to understand the concepts presented 
in this chapter is that p-values are random variables. To see this, consider 
the example in which we define a p-value from a t-test with a large enough 
sample size to use the CLT approximation. Then our p-value is defined as the 
probability that a normally distributed random variable is larger, in absolute 
value, than the observed t-test, call it <i>Z</i>. So for a two sided test the 
p-value is: 

![](../fig/pequals.png) 

In R, we write:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(Z)))
```

Now because <i>Z</i> is a random variable and <i>&Phi;</i> is a deterministic
function, <i>p</i> is also a random variable. We will create a Monte Carlo
simulation showing how the values of <i>p</i> change. We use `femaleControlsPopulation.csv` from earlier chapters.

```{r}
filename <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleControlsPopulation.csv"
```

We read in the data, and use `replicate` to repeatedly create p-values.

```{r pvalue_hist"}
set.seed(1)
population = unlist( read.csv(filename) )
N <- 12
B <- 10000
pvals <- replicate(B, {
  control = sample(population, N)
  treatment = sample(population, N)
  t.test(treatment, control)$p.val 
  })
hist(pvals)
```
![P-value histogram for 10,000 tests in which null hypothesis is true.](../fig/pvalue_hist-1.png) 
As implied by the histogram, in this case the distribution of the p-value is 
uniformly distributed. In fact, we can show theoretically that when the null 
hypothesis is true, this is always the case. For the case in which we use the 
CLT, we have that the null hypothesis <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> implies that our test statistic <i>Z</i> follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 1 thus:

![](../fig/psubaequals.png) 
This implies that:

![](../fig/probpltpsuba.png)

which is the definition of a uniform distribution.

#### Thousands of tests

In this data we have two groups denoted with 0 and 1:
```{r}
library(GSE5859Subset)
data(GSE5859Subset)
g <- sampleInfo$group
g
```

If we were interested in a particular gene, let's arbitrarily pick the one on 
the 25th row, we would simply compute a t-test. To compute a p-value, we will 
use the t-distribution approximation and therefore we need the population data 
to be approximately normal. We check this assumption with a qq-plot:

```{r qqplots_for_one_gene}
e <- geneExpression[25, ]

library(rafalib)
mypar(1,2)

qqnorm(e[g==1])
qqline(e[g==1])

qqnorm(e[g==0])
qqline(e[g==0])
```
![Normal qq-plots for one gene. Left plot shows first group and right plot shows second group.](../fig/qqplots_for_one_gene-1.png) 
The qq-plots show that the data is well approximated by the normal 
approximation. The t-test does not find this gene to be statistically 
significant:

```{r}
t.test(e[g==1], e[g==0])$p.value
```

To answer the question for each gene, we simply repeat the above for each gene. 
Here we will define our own function and use `apply`:

```{r}
myttest <- function(x) 
  t.test(x[g==1], 
         x[g==0], 
         var.equal=TRUE)$p.value
pvals <- apply(geneExpression, 1, myttest)
```

We can now see which genes have p-values less than, say, 0.05. For example, 
right away we see that...

```{r}
sum(pvals < 0.05)
```

... genes had p-values less than 0.05.

However, as we will describe in more detail below, we have to be careful in interpreting this result because we have performed over 8,000 tests. If we 
performed the same procedure on random data, for which the null hypothesis is 
true for all features, we obtain the following results:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
m <- nrow(geneExpression)
n <- ncol(geneExpression)
randomData <- matrix(rnorm(n * m), m, n)
nullpvals <- apply(randomData, 1, myttest)
sum(nullpvals < 0.05)
```

> analyses. What do you think the results mean? Then, share your responses with

As we will explain later in the chapter, this is to be expected: 419 is roughly 
0.05 * 8192 and we will describe the theory that tells us why this prediction 
works.

#### Faster t-test implementation

Before we continue, we should point out that the above implementation is very inefficient. There are several faster implementations that perform t-test for high-throughput data. We make use of a function that is not available from CRAN, 
but rather from the Bioconductor project. 

To download and install packages from Bioconductor, we can use the `install_bioc` function in `rafalib` to install the package:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_bioc("genefilter")
```
Now we can show that this function is much faster than our code above and 
produce practically the same answer:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(genefilter)
results <- rowttests(geneExpression, factor(g))
max(abs(pvals - results$p))
```

## Exercises
These exercises will help clarify that p-values are random variables and some of 
the properties of these p-values. Note that just like the sample average is a 
random variable because it is based on a random sample, the p-values are based 
on random variables (sample mean and sample standard deviation for example) and 
thus it is also a random variable.  
To see this, letâ€™s see how p-values change when we take different samples.

```{r p_value_histogram}
set.seed(1)
pvals <- replicate(1000, { # recreate p-values as from above
  control = sample(population, 12) 
  treatment = sample(population, 12) 
  t.test(treatment,control)$p.val
  }
  )
head(pvals)
hist(pvals)
```
