## Introduction

High-throughput technologies have changed basic biology and the biomedical 
sciences from data poor disciplines to data intensive ones. A specific example 
comes from research fields interested in understanding gene expression. Gene 
expression is the process in which DNA, the blueprint for life, is copied into 
RNA, the templates for the synthesis of proteins, the building blocks for life. 
In the 1990s, the analysis of gene expression data amounted to spotting black 
dots on a piece of paper or extracting a few numbers from standard curves. With high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays, this suddenly changed to 
sifting through tens of thousands of numbers. More recently, RNA sequencing has 
further increased data complexity. Biologists went from using their eyes or 
simple summaries to categorize results, to having thousands (and now millions) 
of measurements per sample to analyze. In this chapter, we will focus on 
statistical inference in the context of high-throughput measurements. 
Specifically, we focus on the problem of detecting differences in groups using 
statistical tests and quantifying uncertainty in a meaningful way. We also 
introduce exploratory data analysis techniques that should be used in 
conjunction with inference when analyzing high-throughput data. In later chapters, we will study the statistics behind clustering, machine learning, factor analysis and multi-level modeling. 

> ## Discussion
> Turn to a partner and discuss the following point.    
> More data are better than less data, right? Based on what you already know 
> about statistical inference, do you agree with this or not? 
> Is more data better? Is less data better? Why or why not?
> Share your thoughts responses with the group through the collaborative 
> document.
